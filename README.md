# KPOP Protocol Website

This repository contains the marketing website for **KPOP Protocol (KPP)**, a commercial-grade cryptocurrency project built for the global K-POP community.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Landing page introducing the protocol, technology and token model.
- `team.html`: Overview of the core development team.
- `whitepaper.html`: Multi-language whitepaper.
- Icon-driven lists and a new resources section provide quick links to the whitepaper, GitHub repository and community channels.

Assets are styled with `style.css` and animations are handled in `main.js` using GSAP and a custom Web Component for the animated hero title.

The site is fully static and can be served by any web server.
